# Go API Server for swagger

# Find your nearest MEC platform --- Network operators will typically have multiple MEC sites in a given territory. Connecting your application to a server on the closest MEC platform means the lowest latency - however, the physical location of a user is not an accurate match to the closest MEC site, due to the way operator networks are configured. This API returns the MEC platforms with the _shortest network path_ to the client making the request, and hence the lowest propagation delay. * If you have a server instance deployed there, connect to it to gain the lowest latency * Or if not, you may wish to deploy an instance there using the APIs of the cloud provider supporting that zone.    This API is intended to be called by a client application hosted on a UE attached to the operator network. _Note that the API parameters have been listed in this 'simple API' to align with the full API, but are optional and may not be supported by the API server_ --- 

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen]
(https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
